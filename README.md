# Email Sending and Data Manipulation Project

This project uses libraries to send emails, make HTTP requests, and manipulate data with pandas. Below are the instructions to install the necessary libraries and set up the environment.

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have Python installed on your machine. It is recommended to use a virtual environment to avoid dependency conflicts.

    cd your-repository
    ```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment:
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate   # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3. Install the dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install smtplib
    pip install email
    pip install requests
    pip install pandas
    ```
